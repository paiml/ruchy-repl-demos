## Version Comparison: v1.17.0 → v1.18.0

### ✅ What Remains Working (100% Stability)

All previously working features continue to function identically:

1. **Core Language Features**
   - Arithmetic operators (including `**` for exponentiation)
   - Variable assignments and scoping
   - Function definitions without type annotations
   - Closures with `|x| x * 2` syntax
   - Array literals and operations
   - Control flow (if/else, loops)

2. **Array Methods**
   - `.map()` - Transform elements
   - `.filter()` - Select elements
   - `.reduce()` - Aggregate values
   - `.sum()` - Sum integers
   - `.len()` - Get length
   - `.reverse()` - Reverse order

3. **One-liner Capabilities**
   - All 90 one-liner demos work perfectly
   - Complex functional chains
   - File I/O operations
   - Mathematical computations
   - Text processing

### ❌ What Still Doesn't Work (Unchanged)

The same 67 REPL demos fail with identical error patterns:

1. **Rust Type System** (Not Supported)
   ```rust
   // Still fails in v1.18.0
   fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 { x + y }
   let nums: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
   ```

2. **Rust Standard Library** (Not Available)
   ```rust
   // Still unavailable in v1.18.0
   format!("Hello {}", name)
   Some(value)
   Result<T, E>
   ```

3. **Advanced Rust Features** (Not Implemented)
   - Generic types `<T>`
   - Trait definitions and implementations
   - Lifetime annotations `'a`
   - Pattern matching with `match`
   - Unsafe blocks

## Detailed Category Analysis

### REPL Demos by Category

| Category | v1.17.0 | v1.18.0 | Files | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| 01-basics | 8/10 (80%) | 8/10 (80%) | Same files pass/fail | ✅ Stable |
| 02-functions | 4/10 (40%) | 4/10 (40%) | Same files pass/fail | ✅ Stable |
| 03-data-structures | 4/15 (27%) | 4/15 (27%) | Same files pass/fail | ✅ Stable |
| 04-algorithms | 0/10 (0%) | 0/10 (0%) | All still fail | ✅ Stable |
| 05-functional | 1/20 (5%) | 1/20 (5%) | Same file passes | ✅ Stable |
| 06-advanced | 1/20 (5%) | 1/20 (5%) | Same file passes | ✅ Stable |

### One-liner Performance (Unchanged Excellence)

All 90 one-liners maintain 100% success rate:
- Text processing: 10/10 ✅
- Data analysis: 15/15 ✅
- File operations: 10/10 ✅
- Math calculations: 10/10 ✅
- System scripting: 20/20 ✅
- Functional chains: 25/25 ✅

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Consistent Error Messages (v1.17 = v1.18)

The error patterns remain identical:
1. `"Expected type"` - 67% of failures (Rust type syntax)
2. `"Expected RightBracket, found Comma"` - Array syntax issues
3. `"Expected '|' after lambda parameters"` - Closure syntax
4. `"Unexpected token: ColonColon"` - Rust `::` path syntax

No new error types introduced, no error messages changed.
