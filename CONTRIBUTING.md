# Contributing to Ruchy REPL & One-Liner Demos

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Ruchy demonstration suite! This guide will help you contribute high-quality demos that help others learn Ruchy.

## üéØ Contribution Philosophy

We follow the **Toyota Way** quality principles:
- **Zero Defects**: Every demo must work perfectly
- **Continuous Improvement**: Always looking for better examples
- **Respect for People**: Clear, helpful demonstrations that respect learners' time

## üìã Types of Contributions

### 1. New Demonstrations
- REPL interactive examples
- One-liner scripts
- Advanced pattern demonstrations

### 2. Improvements
- Bug fixes in existing demos
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation clarifications

### 3. Documentation
- Tutorials for specific concepts
- Translation to other languages
- Video demonstrations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install Ruchy v1.9.1 or higher:
   ```bash
   cargo install ruchy
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paiml/ruchy-repl-demos.git
   cd ruchy-repl-demos
   ```

3. Run validation:
   ```bash
   make validate
   ```

## üìù Demo Guidelines

### REPL Demo Structure
```ruchy
// demos/repl/category/demo_name.repl
// Description: What this demo teaches
// Concept: Core concept being demonstrated

// Setup code
let x = 10

// Main demonstration
fn example() {
    // Core logic here
}

// Expected output shown as comments
example()  // Output: result
```

### One-Liner Structure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# demos/one-liners/category/demo_name.sh
# Description: What this one-liner does

echo "Description of what we're doing:"
ruchy -e 'actual_code_here'
```

## üîç Quality Standards

### Before Submitting
Every demo MUST:
- [ ] Work with current Ruchy version
- [ ] Focus on ONE concept
- [ ] Include clear comments
- [ ] Execute in < 100ms
- [ ] Pass syntax validation
- [ ] Have meaningful variable names

### Testing Your Demo
```bash
# Test a REPL demo
ruchy repl < your_demo.repl

# Test a one-liner
bash your_demo.sh

# Run full test suite
make test

# Check quality gates
make quality-gate
```

## üìä Performance Requirements

| Demo Type | Max Execution Time | Memory Limit |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Basic REPL | 50ms | 10MB |
| Complex REPL | 100ms | 50MB |
| One-liner | 100ms | 25MB |
| Algorithm Demo | 500ms | 100MB |

## üé® Code Style

### DO ‚úÖ
```ruchy
// Clear, descriptive names
let user_age = 25
let is_valid = true

// Explain complex logic
// Calculate factorial recursively
fn factorial(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 { 1 } else { n * factorial(n - 1) }
}
```

### DON'T ‚ùå
```ruchy
// Avoid unclear names
let x = 25
let flag = true

// Don't skip explanations
fn f(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 { 1 } else { n * f(n - 1) }
}
```
