## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Running REPL Demos
```bash
# Run a specific REPL demo
ruchy repl < demos/repl/01-basics/demo_01_arithmetic.repl

# Run all REPL demos
make demos-repl
```

### Running One-Liners
```bash
# Execute a specific one-liner
./demos/one-liners/math-calculations/factorial.sh

# Run all one-liners
make demos-oneliner
```

### Testing & Validation
```bash
# Run all tests
make test
