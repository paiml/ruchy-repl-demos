# 1.2 Variables and Assignment

Master variable declaration, assignment, and scoping rules in Ruchy through interactive exploration.

## Introduction

Variables are containers for storing data values. In this section, you'll learn how to create variables, understand Ruchy's type system, and work with different kinds of data storage.

## Variable Declaration

In Ruchy, you declare variables using the `let` keyword:

```ruchy
>>> let x = 10
>>> x
10
```

**Test Status:** ✅ Verified with ruchy v1.14.0

### Basic Variable Assignment

```ruchy
>>> let name = "Ruchy"
>>> let age = 5
>>> let version = 1.14
>>> name
"Ruchy"
>>> age
5
>>> version
1.14
```

## Working with Different Types

### Integers

```ruchy
>>> let count = 42
>>> let negative = -17
>>> let zero = 0
>>> count + negative
25
```

### Floating-Point Numbers

```ruchy
>>> let pi = 3.14159
>>> let temperature = 98.6
>>> let ratio = 2.5
>>> pi * ratio
7.853975
```

### Strings

```ruchy
>>> let greeting = "Hello, World!"
>>> let language = "Ruchy"
>>> let message = greeting + " Welcome to " + language
>>> message
"Hello, World! Welcome to Ruchy"
```

### Booleans

```ruchy
>>> let is_ready = true
>>> let is_complete = false
>>> let result = is_ready && !is_complete
>>> result
true
```

## Type Inference

Ruchy automatically infers types from values:

```ruchy
>>> let number = 42        // Inferred as integer
>>> let decimal = 3.14     // Inferred as float
>>> let text = "hello"     // Inferred as string
>>> let flag = true        // Inferred as boolean
```

## Variable Reassignment

Variables in Ruchy are immutable by default:

```ruchy
>>> let x = 5
>>> let x = 10  // This creates a new binding, shadowing the old one
>>> x
10
```

For mutable variables, use `mut`:

```ruchy
>>> let mut counter = 0
>>> counter = counter + 1
>>> counter
1
>>> counter += 5
>>> counter
6
```

## Practical Examples

### Calculate Circle Properties

```ruchy
>>> let pi = 3.14159
>>> let radius = 5
>>> let diameter = 2 * radius
>>> let circumference = 2 * pi * radius
>>> let area = pi * radius * radius
>>> diameter
10
>>> circumference
31.4159
>>> area
78.53975
```

### Working with Names

```ruchy
>>> let first_name = "Alice"
>>> let last_name = "Johnson"
>>> let full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
>>> let initials = first_name.chars().nth(0).unwrap().to_string() + "." + 
...     &last_name.chars().nth(0).unwrap().to_string() + "."
>>> full_name
"Alice Johnson"
```

### Temperature Conversion

```ruchy
>>> let celsius = 25
>>> let fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32
>>> let kelvin = celsius + 273.15
>>> fahrenheit
77
>>> kelvin
298.15
```

## Variable Scope

Variables have scope - the region where they're accessible:

```ruchy
>>> let outer = "I'm outside"
>>> {
...     let inner = "I'm inside"
...     println!("{}", outer)    // Can access outer
...     println!("{}", inner)    // Can access inner
... }
>>> // inner is not accessible here
>>> println!("{}", outer)        // outer is still accessible
```

## Shadowing

You can create new variables with the same name:

```ruchy
>>> let x = 5
>>> println!("{}", x)  // Prints 5
>>> let x = "hello"    // Different type, new variable
>>> println!("{}", x)  // Prints "hello"
>>> let x = x.len()    // Use previous x to create new x
>>> println!("{}", x)  // Prints 5 (length of "hello")
```

## Constants

For values that never change, use constants:

```ruchy
>>> const PI: f64 = 3.14159265359;
>>> const MAX_USERS: i32 = 1000;
>>> PI
3.14159265359
```

## Common Patterns

### Multiple Assignment

```ruchy
>>> let a = 1
>>> let b = 2
>>> let c = 3
>>> let sum = a + b + c
>>> sum
6
```

### Tuple Destructuring

```ruchy
>>> let point = (10, 20)
>>> let (x, y) = point
>>> x
10
>>> y
20
```

### Working with Calculations

```ruchy
>>> let principal = 1000.0
>>> let rate = 0.05
>>> let time = 3.0
>>> let interest = principal * rate * time
>>> let total = principal + interest
>>> interest
150.0
>>> total
1150.0
```

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Forgetting `mut` for Mutable Variables

```ruchy
// ❌ This will error:
// let counter = 0
// counter += 1

// ✅ Use mut for variables you want to change:
>>> let mut counter = 0
>>> counter += 1
>>> counter
1
```

### Mixing Types Without Conversion

```ruchy
// ❌ This might not work as expected:
// let number = 5
// let text = "The number is " + number

// ✅ Convert types explicitly:
>>> let number = 5
>>> let text = "The number is ".to_string() + &number.to_string()
>>> text
"The number is 5"
```

## Test Your Understanding

Try these exercises in your REPL:

1. Create variables for your name, age, and favorite programming language
2. Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with width 8 and height 12
3. Create a temperature converter that converts 0°C to Fahrenheit and Kelvin

**Solutions:**

```ruchy
>>> // Exercise 1
>>> let name = "Alice"
>>> let age = 25
>>> let favorite_lang = "Ruchy"

>>> // Exercise 2
>>> let width = 8
>>> let height = 12
>>> let area = width * height
>>> let perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
>>> area
96
>>> perimeter
40

>>> // Exercise 3
>>> let celsius = 0
>>> let fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32
>>> let kelvin = celsius + 273.15
>>> fahrenheit
32
>>> kelvin
273.15
```

## Summary

You've mastered variables and assignment in Ruchy:

✅ **Variable Declaration**: Using `let` keyword  
✅ **Type System**: Automatic type inference  
✅ **Mutability**: `mut` for changeable variables  
✅ **Scope Rules**: Block-based scoping  
✅ **Shadowing**: Creating new variables with same name
