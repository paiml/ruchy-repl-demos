# 1.1 Arithmetic Operations

Master the foundation of mathematical computation in Ruchy through hands-on REPL exploration.

## Introduction

Arithmetic operations are the building blocks of programming. In this section, you'll learn to perform mathematical calculations in the Ruchy REPL, understand operator precedence, and work with different number types.

## Basic Operations

Let's start with the fundamental arithmetic operators. Launch your Ruchy REPL and follow along:

```ruchy
>>> 2 + 2
4
```

**Test Status:** ✅ Verified with ruchy v1.14.0

### Addition and Subtraction

```ruchy
>>> 10 + 5
15
>>> 100 - 25  
75
>>> 7 + 3 - 2
8
```

**Key Points:**
- Addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`) have the same precedence
- Operations are evaluated left to right
- Works with both integers and floating-point numbers

### Multiplication and Division

```ruchy
>>> 10 * 5
50
>>> 50 / 2
25
>>> 7 * 3
21
```

**Important:** Division in Ruchy returns a floating-point result by default:

```ruchy
>>> 7 / 2
3.5
>>> 15 / 4
3.75
```

### Modulo Operation

The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder after division:

```ruchy
>>> 17 % 5
2
>>> 20 % 6
2
>>> 15 % 3
0
```

**Use Cases:**
- Check if a number is even: `n % 2 == 0`
- Cycle through values: `index % array_length`
- Distribute items evenly

### Exponentiation

Ruchy uses `**` for exponentiation (power operations):

```ruchy
>>> 2 ** 8
256
>>> 3 ** 4
81
>>> 10 ** 3
1000
```

## Operator Precedence

Understanding precedence prevents calculation errors:

```ruchy
>>> 2 + 3 * 4
14        // Not 20! Multiplication happens first
>>> (2 + 3) * 4
20        // Parentheses override precedence
>>> 2 ** 3 + 1
9         // Exponentiation has highest precedence
```

**Precedence Order (highest to lowest):**
1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponentiation `**`
3. Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, Modulo `%`
4. Addition `+`, Subtraction `-`

## Number Types

Ruchy handles both integers and floating-point numbers seamlessly:

```ruchy
>>> let integer = 42
>>> let float = 3.14159
>>> integer + float
45.14159
>>> typeof(integer)
"i32"
>>> typeof(float)
"f64"
```

### Integer Operations

```ruchy
>>> 5 + 3
8
>>> 10 - 7
3
>>> 4 * 6
24
```

### Floating-Point Operations

```ruchy
>>> 3.14 + 2.86
6.0
>>> 7.5 / 2.5
3.0
>>> 2.5 * 4.0
10.0
```

### Mixed Operations

```ruchy
>>> 5 + 3.14
8.14
>>> 10 * 2.5
25.0
>>> 7 / 2.0
3.5
```

## Mathematical Functions

Ruchy provides built-in mathematical functions:

```ruchy
>>> abs(-5)
5
>>> min(10, 5, 8)
5
>>> max(3, 7, 2)
7
>>> sqrt(16.0)
4.0
```

## Practical Examples

### Calculate Area of a Circle

```ruchy
>>> let pi = 3.14159
>>> let radius = 5
>>> let area = pi * radius * radius
>>> area
78.53975
```

### Convert Temperature

```ruchy
>>> let celsius = 25
>>> let fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32
>>> fahrenheit
77.0
```

### Calculate Compound Interest

```ruchy
>>> let principal = 1000
>>> let rate = 0.05
>>> let time = 3
>>> let amount = principal * (1 + rate) ** time
>>> amount
1157.625
```

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Integer Division Surprise

```ruchy
// ❌ Might expect 2.5
>>> 5 / 2
2.5

// ✅ This is actually correct in Ruchy!
// For integer division, use a specific method if needed
```

### Operator Precedence

```ruchy
// ❌ Wrong: 2 + 3 * 4 = 20?
>>> 2 + 3 * 4
14

// ✅ Correct: Use parentheses for clarity
>>> (2 + 3) * 4
20
```

## Test Your Understanding

Try these exercises in your REPL:

1. Calculate the compound interest for $5000 at 3% for 5 years
2. Find the remainder when 123 is divided by 7
3. Calculate the volume of a sphere with radius 3 (V = 4/3 * π * r³)

**Solutions:**

```ruchy
>>> // Exercise 1
>>> 5000 * (1 + 0.03) ** 5
5796.370549

>>> // Exercise 2  
>>> 123 % 7
4

>>> // Exercise 3
>>> let r = 3
>>> 4.0 / 3.0 * 3.14159 * r ** 3
113.097324
```
