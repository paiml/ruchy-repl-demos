# Ruchy WebAssembly & REPL Mastery

**Production-Ready WebAssembly Development**

*A comprehensive guide to building high-performance, cross-platform applications with Ruchy's native WebAssembly compilation*

---

## About This Book

This book teaches **WASM-first development** using Ruchy v2.1.0's native WebAssembly compilation capabilities. Every example compiles to production-ready WASM modules that deploy instantly to:

- **Browser Applications** (JavaScript interop)
- **Node.js Server Modules** (high-performance backends)  
- **Cloudflare Workers** (edge computing)
- **AWS Lambda** (serverless functions)
- **Vercel** (JAMstack deployment)
- **Deno** (modern runtime integration)

## What Makes This Different

**WASM-First Approach**: Write once in Ruchy, deploy everywhere as optimized WebAssembly.

**Production Testing**: Every code example is validated across all deployment platforms.

**Quality Gates**: All modules pass security validation, performance benchmarks, and quality scoring.

**Test-Driven Learning**: TDD methodology with REPL validation for every concept.

## Who This Book Is For

- **Web Developers** seeking high-performance alternatives to JavaScript
- **Backend Engineers** building scalable microservices  
- **DevOps Teams** deploying to edge computing platforms
- **Data Scientists** requiring fast numerical computations
- **System Programmers** targeting WebAssembly runtimes

## Prerequisites
