# Chapter 8: Data Science Analytics

## Test-Driven Data Science with Canonical Datasets

**Quality Commitment**: Every example tested first, documented second. Zero broken demos.

Data science in Ruchy demonstrates powerful interactive analysis capabilities using industry-standard datasets. This chapter covers four canonical datasets used by data science students worldwide:

- **Iris Dataset (1936)**: The "Hello World" of machine learning
- **Titanic Dataset (1912)**: Real-world survival analysis  
- **Boston Housing (1978)**: Regression and price prediction
- **Wine Quality (2009)**: Feature correlation and classification

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will understand:

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Computing means, medians, distributions
2. **Data Filtering**: Finding patterns in complex datasets
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new insights from existing data
4. **Classification Rules**: Simple prediction models
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Group-by operations and demographics
6. **Feature Correlation**: Understanding what drives outcomes

## Prerequisites

- Basic REPL usage (Chapter 1)
- Array operations and filtering (Chapter 1, 3)
- Function definitions (Chapter 2)
- Data structures (Chapter 3)
