# Chapter 1: Basics - Test-Driven Foundation

Welcome to your first chapter in test-driven Ruchy learning! This chapter covers fundamental concepts through interactive REPL sessions, where every example has been tested and validated.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Master basic arithmetic operations in the REPL
- Understand variable assignment and scoping  
- Work confidently with strings and text
- Use boolean logic effectively
- Create and manipulate arrays and collections

## Test-Driven Approach

Each section in this chapter follows our quality standards:

```
✅ All examples tested with current Ruchy v1.14.0
✅ REPL sessions verified for correctness
✅ Edge cases and error conditions covered
✅ Performance within acceptable limits (< 100ms)
```
