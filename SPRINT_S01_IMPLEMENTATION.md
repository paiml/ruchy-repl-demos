# Sprint S01: Foundation Quality Implementation

**Sprint Duration**: Days 1-2  
**Start Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Focus**: Implement core quality infrastructure using proven ../ruchy-book patterns  

## Sprint Goal

Establish the same production-ready quality pipeline that achieved 100% standards in ../ruchy-book, adapting it for the demo suite structure.

## Implementation Checklist

### Day 1 Morning: Quality Infrastructure Setup

#### ✅ QUAL-001: PMAT Quality Gates (P0)
```bash
# 1. Check if PMAT is installed
which pmat || cargo install pmat

# 2. Create PMAT configuration
cat > pmat.toml << 'EOF'
[quality]
max_cyclomatic_complexity = 10
max_cognitive_complexity = 15
max_satd_comments = 0
max_dead_code_percentage = 5.0
min_code_entropy = 2.0

[reporting]
format = "markdown"
output = "reports/pmat_quality.md"
EOF

# 3. Run baseline PMAT analysis
pmat quality-gate --fail-on-violation --checks=all --format=summary

# 4. Document current violations for fixing
pmat analyze complexity --top-files 10 > reports/pmat_baseline.md
```

#### ✅ Pre-commit Hook Setup
```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

echo "🔒 MANDATORY Quality Gates..."

# GATE 1: Ruchy test validation
echo "Running ruchy test validation..."
ruchy test tests/ || {
    echo "❌ BLOCKED: Tests failing"
    exit 1
}

# GATE 2: Coverage check (following ../ruchy-book success)
echo "Running coverage validation..."
ruchy test --coverage tests/ || {
    echo "❌ BLOCKED: Coverage check failed"
    exit 1
}

# GATE 3: Quality score check
echo "Running quality score validation..."
ruchy score tests/ --min 0.85 || {
    echo "❌ BLOCKED: Quality score below threshold"
    exit 1
}

# GATE 4: PMAT complexity check
echo "Running PMAT quality gates..."
pmat quality-gate --fail-on-violation --checks=all \
  --max-complexity-p99 10 \
  --max-dead-code 5.0 \
  --min-entropy 2.0 || {
    echo "❌ BLOCKED: PMAT quality gate failed"
    exit 1
}

echo "✅ All quality gates passed"
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Day 1 Afternoon: Coverage Pipeline Implementation

#### ✅ QUAL-002: Test Coverage Pipeline (P0)
```bash
# 1. Update Makefile with coverage targets (from ../ruchy-book)
cat >> Makefile << 'EOF'

# Quality Tools (Production Ready - v1.27.5)
.PHONY: quality-test quality-coverage quality-score quality-lint quality-all

quality-test:
	@echo "Running ruchy test (100% pass required)..."
	@ruchy test tests/ || exit 1
	@ruchy test demos/one-liners/ || exit 1
	@ruchy test demos/repl/ || exit 1

quality-coverage:
	@echo "Running coverage analysis (100% required)..."
	@ruchy test --coverage tests/ --threshold 100 || exit 1
	@ruchy test --coverage demos/ --threshold 100 || exit 1

quality-score:
	@echo "Running quality scoring (≥0.85 required)..."
	@ruchy score tests/ --min 0.85 || exit 1
	@ruchy score demos/ --min 0.85 || exit 1

quality-lint:
	@echo "Running lint checks (advisory only)..."
	@ruchy lint --all tests/ || true
	@ruchy lint --all demos/ || true
	@echo "Note: Lint has known false positives (26.3% clean is acceptable)"

quality-all: quality-test quality-coverage quality-score quality-lint
	@echo "✅ All quality gates completed"

# PMAT Integration
.PHONY: pmat-check pmat-baseline pmat-fix

pmat-check:
	@pmat quality-gate --fail-on-violation --checks=all

pmat-baseline:
	@pmat analyze complexity --top-files 10 --format=markdown > reports/pmat_baseline.md
	@pmat analyze satd --format=summary > reports/pmat_satd.md
	@pmat analyze dead-code --format=summary > reports/pmat_deadcode.md

pmat-fix:
	@echo "Analyzing complexity hotspots..."
	@pmat analyze complexity --max-cyclomatic 10 --max-cognitive 15 --fail-on-violation
EOF
```

#### ✅ Test Coverage for Existing Demos
```bash
# 1. Verify current test files
ls -la tests/*.ruchy

# 2. Run coverage on existing tests
ruchy test --coverage tests/test_basics.ruchy
ruchy test --coverage tests/test_functions.ruchy
ruchy test --coverage tests/test_oneliners.ruchy
ruchy test --coverage tests/test_arrays.ruchy

# 3. Generate coverage report
mkdir -p reports
ruchy test --coverage tests/ > reports/coverage_baseline.md
```

### Day 2 Morning: Apply Quality Standards

#### ✅ QUAL-003: Quality Score Implementation (P0)
```bash
# 1. Run quality scoring on all demos
ruchy score tests/ > reports/quality_scores.md
ruchy score demos/one-liners/ >> reports/quality_scores.md
ruchy score demos/repl/ >> reports/quality_scores.md

# 2. Identify demos below 0.85 threshold
grep -B1 "Score: 0\.[0-7]" reports/quality_scores.md > reports/quality_improvements_needed.md

# 3. Document improvement plan for low-scoring demos
```

#### ✅ Fix Existing Quality Issues
```bash
# 1. Fix SATD comments (if any)
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" tests/ demos/ --include="*.ruchy"

# 2. Fix complexity violations
pmat analyze complexity --max-cyclomatic 10 --top-files 5

# 3. Remove dead code
pmat analyze dead-code --max-dead-code 5.0
```

### Day 2 Afternoon: Documentation & Reporting

#### ✅ Generate Quality Baseline Report
```bash
cat > reports/QUALITY_BASELINE_S01.md << 'EOF'
# Sprint S01 Quality Baseline Report

**Generated**: $(date -I)
**Sprint**: S01 (Foundation Quality)
**Ruchy Version**: $(ruchy --version)

#### ✅ Update ROADMAP with Progress
```bash
# Mark completed tickets in ROADMAP_V2.md
# Update status from TODO to DONE for:
# - QUAL-001: PMAT quality gates
# - QUAL-002: Test coverage pipeline
# - QUAL-003: Quality scoring

# Document actual story points used vs estimated
# Record any blockers or discoveries
```

## Sprint S01 Success Criteria

### Must Complete (P0)
- [x] PMAT configuration and pre-commit hooks
- [x] Test coverage pipeline operational
- [x] Quality scoring integrated
- [x] Baseline reports generated

### Should Complete (P1)
- [ ] Fix critical complexity violations
- [ ] Document quality standards
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline

### Could Complete (P2)
- [ ] Add property-based tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Formal verification examples

## Commands Reference

### Daily Quality Check
```bash
# Run every morning
make quality-all
make pmat-check
```

### Before Commit
```bash
# Automatic via pre-commit hook
# Or manually:
make quality-test quality-coverage quality-score
```

### Sprint Review
```bash
# Generate final report
make quality-all > reports/sprint_s01_final.md
make pmat-baseline >> reports/sprint_s01_final.md
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Issues from ../ruchy-book
1. **Lint false positives**: 26.3% clean is acceptable
2. **Coverage edge cases**: Focus on line coverage, not branch
3. **Score variations**: 0.85 minimum, 1.00 target

### Contingency Plans
- If PMAT blocks: Temporarily reduce complexity threshold
- If coverage fails: Focus on critical paths first
- If scores low: Document and plan improvements for S02

## Definition of Done

A ticket is DONE when:
1. ✅ Code changes complete
2. ✅ Tests pass (ruchy test)
3. ✅ Coverage 100% (ruchy test --coverage)
4. ✅ Score ≥0.85 (ruchy score)
5. ✅ PMAT passes (pmat quality-gate)
6. ✅ Documentation updated
7. ✅ Committed to main branch

**Remember**: We're applying the PROVEN quality pipeline from ../ruchy-book that achieved 100% production readiness. Every step has been validated and proven to work.
