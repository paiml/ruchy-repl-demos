## Sprint Metrics
| Sprint | Planned | Completed | Velocity | Quality |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| S01    | 15 pts  | TBD       | TBD      | TBD     |
| S02    | 12 pts  | -         | -        | -       |

## Risk Register
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Ruchy syntax changes | HIGH | Version pinning, compatibility matrix |
| Performance regression | MEDIUM | Automated benchmarking |
| Platform incompatibility | MEDIUM | POSIX compliance, minimal shell |
| Test coverage gaps | LOW | YAML test generation |
